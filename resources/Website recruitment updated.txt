I am recruiting honours and graduate students for the 2022-2023 academic year. Prospective honours students should carefully research NUS requirements and departmental deadlines.  Prospective graduate students should have a strong background in psychology or related fields, including research methods and statistics, and prior research experience. If you meet the necessary requirements, please contact me for further information.
