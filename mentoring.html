        <p>In the Learning Sciences Laboratory, major topics of study include the optimization of learning in science education, text processing, spelling, and other domains, as well as test-enhanced learning and learning from errors.   Ongoing and recent projects have also addressed human learning and knowledge representation, memory retrieval processes, acquisition and transfer of skills, the role of sleep in learning and memory, skill-training programs, and the cognitive processes underlying recall from long-term memory.</p>

          <h2>Interested in Learning Sciences Research?</h2>

        <p>If you are an undergraduate who is interested in joining the laboratory, please contact: <a href="mailto:scp@nus.edu.sg">scp@nus.edu.sg</a>.  To apply, please email: (1) class schedule screenshot; (2) any work/time commitments; (3) class level (e.g., freshman), (4) GPA; (5) degree goal (e.g., PSYC BS). Optional: CV, prior research experience, unofficial transcript. </p>
		<p>If you are a prospective graduate student, please send a short email (1) summarizing your research interests and proposed direction of graduate study; (2) your CV, which should include details of all prior research experiences; (3) links to any conference abstracts, research presentations, or publications; (4) unofficial transcript; and (5) if you did not complete a psychology degree, please indicate what courses you have taken in the areas of research methods, statistics, and/or programming. Note: funding for PhD students comes from various sources.  It is fairly common to engage in part-time assistant teaching, which can help cover tuition / fees.  As an alternative, one can apply for <a href="https://fass.nus.edu.sg/prospective-students/graduate/research/scholarships/">competitive scholarships</a>.
</p>

      <h2>Undergraduate Research Experiences</h2>

<p>We regularly recruit talented undergraduate students that are interested in learning and memory research as part of university honours programs and other pipeline programs that emphasize research experience.  As such, we strongly encourage interested undergraduates to consider applying for those programs (where eligible).  Students who join our lab through one of these education pipeline programs will receive one-on-one mentorship in the development of an empirical research project, from experimental design to data collection, analysis, and presentation or publication.  This experience often serves as excellent preparation for graduate careers.</p>

        <p>In addition, helping students attain their first research conference presentation experiences is a major focus of our mentorship efforts.  Students working with me typically receive instruction in poster and research talk development, individualized coaching in presentation skills, and advisement on the finer points of data analysis and interpretation.  This culminates in presentations in a variety of venues.  A list of venues that students members have presented at (US examples) include:</p>

        <h2>Graduate Career Advice</h2>

<p>It has been a privilege to advise talented undergraduate students in their pursuit of graduate and other careers. The many success stories that we have been fortunate to play a supporting role in has given me insights into what it takes to succeed after completing one's undergraduate degree -- insights that we've shared with subsequent students. To help even more students, in 2018 we developed and produced the following videos (in partnership with Kaiqi Guo; presented by Natalia Cameroni-Adams), as well as a 10-part how-to-guide which can be viewed at the UCSD <a href="https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/graduate-career-resources/applying-grad-school/index.html">Psychology website</a>.
